jsarmor
=======

**noscript on steroids for opera !**

[Home page](https://github.com/lemonsqueeze/jsarmor/wiki) is in the wiki now.


Extension
---------

There is an extension in the repository, but don't use it yet unless you feel like debugging it. There are [outstanding issues](http://my.opera.com/community/forums/topic.dml?id=1545262) remaining.

Other stuff
-----------

`utils/google_nojs.js`: example showing how to disable javascript but still allow userjs to run on one site only without depending on jsarmor. This one does it for google search.
