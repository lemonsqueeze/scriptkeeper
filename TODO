[ main ]

  - doc or startup: warn about 
        - Speculative parser
        - userjs on https

  - find way to make it work as extension


Urgent:

  - Fix "event received before..." popup msg on install !

  - upon new install, could import some default host settings so that
    important sites work out of the box.
    (ex: imdb which is broken even in relaxed mode)

  - Check what happens for http redirect on script url
    Which url shows up ??

  - display something on main button to notify about important changes: 
    like flash, or blink, small popup, tooltip ...
    (especially important when new script is added after DOM loaded)

  - IFrame handling !
    Scripts from iframe's domain will be run by default
      -> potentially any external script can be run !!
    Also UI showing up: ugly and not useable.
    
    - Ideas:
      1) integrate with external iframe blocking ?
         (so we don't have to click on them on allowed sites)
         - UI: setting to block/allow per page/site/...
         - jsarmor now knows what to do with js in iframes (when blocked at least)
	   -> needs to be notified about click on placeholder.
         - could make it a plugin since we still need privoxy anyway ...  
	   (but ugly code ?)

      2) and/or find a way to communicate iframe's scripts to parent
        -> Parent displays them in menu
           (with something to indicate it comes from an iframe ??)
        -> Iframe needs no jsarmor UI and gets its settings from parent.
  
    - ideal (?): block loading + placeholder
    - less ideal but should work:
      don't show UI and block everything for external iframes
      iframes from the same domain will use the settings from the main window
      (can be scripts in them we don't know anything about but ...)

  - when using 'block all' mode and 'block inline scripts', block these as well ?
      - event handlers
      - javascript url
    cf http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/operaStuff/userjs/disablescript.js    

Features:
  - Settings window,
    About
    way to set defaults    
    view/edit whitelist,
    view/edit blacklist
    reload method
    change font, skin
    import/export settings ...

UI Enhancements:
  - noscript title clobbers beautiful shaded effect
      increase top padding/margin ?
  - Scrolling problems: can we put scrollbars in DIV ?
    otherwise use popup window ?
  - transparent button ?
    dev.opera.com/articles/view/beautiful-ui-styling-with-css3-text-shadow-box-shadow-and-border-radius/

Before Release:
  - test: - different versions of opera
          - windows.
  - documentation
  - update global whitelist:
    use current settings to compile whitelist.
    make sure mainstream stuff works out of the box
    (youtube, google maps, flickr ...)
  - nice welcome message
  - needs setting to run on https sites
    -> can use opera.setPreference() to set it !!!
  - decent iframe behaviour
  - Check UI with normal fonts
  - credits
  - clear ui, tooltips, doc ...
  - config window, default settings etc

Optimization/Cleanup:
  - cache script storage settings instead of accessing every time ?
  - move CSS out of javascript (prob. more efficient for browser?)

[ FIXME: relaxed mode issues ]

- github doesn't work by default: needs akamai stuff
  https://a248.e.akamai.net/assets.github.com/assets/frameworks-cc4895cbb610429d2ce48e7c2392822c33db2dfe.js

- this one would be helpful to have (gets blocked right now)
  http://www.google.com/jsapi

- imdb is broken needs 
  www.amazon.com

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ FIXME ]

  - investigate: with 'allow all' (and ghostery running)
    this one uses 'data:text/javascript' urls and the main display is getting
    confused. i suspect a trick to hide third party content there ...
    http://dictionary.reference.com/

  - Move styles into CSS
  - cleanup

Extension problems (not userjs):
  Really strange stuff going on right now like:
  
   * BeforeExternalScript not firing
   and BeforeScript as well for some pages, but only when opened as a new tabs (how weird!!)
   * reload logic not working (probably deserved, it's quite a hack =)
   maybe createEvent / dispatchEvent can't be used inside extensions.
   at any rate it seems i have to fall back to location.reload(true), which works but what a waste...
  
  I guess userjs and extension contexts are actually quite different.
  
  I put some debugging code in, turns out:
   Part of the problem is a race condition which is sometimes lost between handler setup
   and the first events firing, that i can deal with.
   But there are also cases where the race is not lost and we still miss events.
   As if events fired even before the extension started. (i have a bad feeling about this)
  
  Reproduce:
    - get_domain_node() failed
      when opening page as a new tab (reload is fine)
        http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/converting-userjs-to-extensions/
        (opened from google search)
    - reload from cache not working, button goes away (wikipedia)
      but full reload -> ok


Sites:
  - stackechange.com login page, getting jsarmor error in iframe code
    (is their code interfering ??)
    http://stackexchange.com/users/login?returnurl=%2f#log-in
    
    Event thread: load
    Uncaught exception: TypeError: Cannot convert 'iframe.contentWindow' to object
    Error thrown at line 1404, column 1 in populate_iframe():
        iframe.contentWindow.name = 'noscript_iframe';

    why jsarmor doesn't show up inside iframe ?

  - slate.com:
    play with menu, after a while jsarmor ui disappears !

  - google maps in iframe:
    http://www.fermedescharrieres.fr/contact.html
    can't load ...

  - http://www.instructables.com/id/Very-simple-PWM-with-555Modulate-every-thing/
    what is this data:javascript ... stuff ??

  - Menu stops showing up (scroll down a little)

    cached reload hack doesn't reload anything!
  - http://www.costaroche.fr.st/
    changing settings reloads current frame, but not others
    -> how do we reload the whole page ??
    top.location.reload() doesn't work either

  - http://precarioussecurity.blogspot.fr/2012/03/simulated-man-in-middle-with-privoxy.html
    noscript ui not showing up!
  - lemonde.fr
    almost hides button

[ IDEAS ]

Features:

- option to build database of scripts used by websites ?
  would be useful for testing
- show script sizes in kb for external scripts loaded
- way to find out about dns aliases in JS ?
- shut the door! block outgoing requests once DOM loaded !!
- show big inline scripts, allow to block them!
- way to make it work when using offline with mht files ?
  (permission problem creating iframe ui...)

- use JSON instead of de/serializing arrays by hand ?
- XSS ??
- Detect / block ajax ?
- display info on startup ? in bottom bar a la noscript or with timer ?
- way to disable / hide ui temporarily ?
