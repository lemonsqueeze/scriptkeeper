[ TODO ]

  - doc or startup: warn about 
        - Speculative parser
        - userjs on https

  - find way to make it work as extension


Urgent:

  - Check what happens for http redirect on script url
    Which url shows up ??

  - display something on main button to notify about important changes: 
    like flash, or blink, small popup, tooltip ...
    (especially important when new script is added after DOM loaded)

  - IFrame handling !
    Scripts from iframe's domain will be run by default
      -> potentially any external script can be run !!
    Also UI showing up: ugly and not useable.
    
    - Ideas:
      1) integrate with external iframe blocking ?
         (so we don't have to click on them on allowed sites)
         - UI: setting to block/allow per page/site/...
         - jsarmor now knows what to do with js in iframes (when blocked at least)
	   -> needs to be notified about click on placeholder.
         - could make it a plugin since we still need privoxy anyway ...  
	   (but ugly code ?)

      2) and/or find a way to communicate iframe's scripts to parent
        -> Parent displays them in menu
           (with something to indicate it comes from an iframe ??)
        -> Iframe needs no jsarmor UI and gets its settings from parent.
  
    - ideal (?): block loading + placeholder
    - less ideal but should work:
      don't show UI and block everything for external iframes
      iframes from the same domain will use the settings from the main window
      (can be scripts in them we don't know anything about but ...)

Features:
  - Settings window,
    About
    way to set defaults    
    view/edit whitelist,
    view/edit blacklist
    reload method
    change font, skin
    import/export settings ...

UI Enhancements:
  - noscript title clobbers beautiful shaded effect
      increase top padding/margin ?
  - Scrolling problems: can we put scrollbars in DIV ?
    otherwise use popup window ?
  - transparent button ?
    dev.opera.com/articles/view/beautiful-ui-styling-with-css3-text-shadow-box-shadow-and-border-radius/

Before Release:
  - test: - different versions of opera
          - windows.
  - documentation
  - update global whitelist:
    use current settings to compile whitelist.
    make sure mainstream stuff works out of the box
    (youtube, google maps, flickr ...)
  - nice welcome message
  - needs setting to run on https sites
    -> can use opera.setPreference() to set it !!!
  - decent iframe behaviour
  - Check UI with normal fonts
  - credits
  - clear ui, tooltips, doc ...
  - config window, default settings etc

Optimization/Cleanup:
  - cache script storage settings instead of accessing every time ?
  - move CSS out of javascript (prob. more efficient for browser?)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------

[ FIXME! ]

  - Move styles into CSS
  - FIXME comments in the code

Extension problems (not userjs):
  Really strange stuff going on right now like:
  
   * BeforeExternalScript not firing
   and BeforeScript as well for some pages, but only when opened as a new tabs (how weird!!)
   * reload logic not working (probably deserved, it's quite a hack =)
   maybe createEvent / dispatchEvent can't be used inside extensions.
   at any rate it seems i have to fall back to location.reload(true), which works but what a waste...
  
  I guess userjs and extension contexts are actually quite different.
  
  I put some debugging code in, turns out:
   Part of the problem is a race condition which is sometimes lost between handler setup
   and the first events firing, that i can deal with.
   But there are also cases where the race is not lost and we still miss events.
   As if events fired even before the extension started. (i have a bad feeling about this)
  
  Reproduce:
    - get_domain_node() failed
      when opening page as a new tab (reload is fine)
        http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/converting-userjs-to-extensions/
        (opened from google search)
    - reload from cache not working, button goes away (wikipedia)
      but full reload -> ok


Sites:
  - http://biggeekdad.com/2011/01/wingsuit-basejumping/
    why jsarmor doesn't show up inside iframe ?

  - slate.com:
    play with menu, after a while jsarmor ui disappears !

  - google maps in iframe:
    http://www.fermedescharrieres.fr/contact.html
    can't load ...

  - http://www.instructables.com/id/Very-simple-PWM-with-555Modulate-every-thing/
    what is this data:javascript ... stuff ??

  - Menu stops showing up (scroll down a little)
    v1.38
    http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0374546/
    
  - http://www.openwifispots.com/city_free_wifi_wireless_hotspot-Albertville_MN.aspx#45.233368,-93.663168,14
    cached reload hack doesn't reload anything!
  - http://www.costaroche.fr.st/
    changing settings reloads current frame, but not others
    -> how do we reload the whole page ??
    top.location.reload() doesn't work either

  - blocking inline scripts doesn't completely block javascript:
    page can still execute js through:
      - event handlers 
      - javascript url
  
    cf http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/operaStuff/userjs/disablescript.js    

  - http://precarioussecurity.blogspot.fr/2012/03/simulated-man-in-middle-with-privoxy.html
    noscript ui not showing up!
  - lemonde.fr
    almost hides button

----------------------------------------------------------------------------  

[ IDEAS ]

Features:

- option to build database of scripts used by websites ?
  would be useful for testing
- show script sizes in kb for external scripts loaded
- way to find out about dns aliases in JS ?
- shut the door! block outgoing requests once DOM loaded !!
- show big inline scripts, allow to block them!
- way to make it work when using offline with mht files ?
  (permission problem creating iframe ui...)
- jsarmor console with messages, events ...

- use JSON instead of de/serializing arrays by hand ?
- XSS ??
- Detect / block ajax ?
  NB: seems slate.com uses ajax
- display info on startup ? in bottom bar a la noscript or with timer ?
- "turn noscript off" for current url or tab (#nsoff ...)
- "show whitelist" button
- selection color -> orange !


Wild stuff:

- visualize 
    js cost
    site's abuse of trust

- awfully cool ui: 
  ship shield display a la tie-fighter
  front/sides/rear shields -> current/related/other(+iframes) domains
  bigger scripts -> more damage!
    (way to animate ? display as page is loading)
  grey transparent ui
  zoom in on mouseover
  tooltips for details
  ship/shield flashing on new event (new script, blocked request ...)


----------------------------------------------------------------------------    
  
DONE:

- don't store default hosts setting for every site
- check script storage availability on startup.
- noscript -> jsarmor renaming (popups etc!)
- "relaxed mode"
  accept current domain + related and helper domains 
- highlight current mode in menu
- Decent radio button styling
- reload from cache !
- move inline script blocking inside "Block All" mode
  doesn't make much sense to block inline and allow external ...
- If domain allowed, but some scripts are blocked by smth else, 
  indicate it with "!" in main menu
- scoped settings
- Filter by host instead of by domain
- use injected iframe -> no interferences with page's css!
- reload when leaving menu, this way we can make several settings at once
- sorting: show current and related domains first
- handle noscript tags as if javascript was disabled when inline scripts are blocked!
- nice shaded gray menu using
  http://dev.opera.com/articles/view/beautiful-ui-styling-with-css3-text-shadow-box-shadow-and-border-radius/
- global whitelist of domains,
  using scriptStorage (opera > 10.50))
  don't want to depend on cookies only for saving stuff:
    - they only work for current domain
    - want to keep them only for the current session
    - difficult to see/export etc
- code cleanup!
- script details: show url with link
- display version somewhere
- display number of scripts for each domain in main menu
- handle .co.uk style domains
- display scripts details:
  blocked/allowed, whitelisted, not loaded (to find if smth else is blocking)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

FIXED:

  - (web dev) issues with local html+js files 
    domain is empty
    file:// url gets rewritten as http:// in script details
  - wn.com gets handled as a .co.uk style domain
  - When moving mouse from menu to window scrollbar:
    Error: cannot convert reltg to object
    in nsmenu.onmouseout
  - domain helpers: look at hostname also
    Ex: api.recaptcha.net   (http://www.rlslog.net/)
        cdn.adk2.com
  - Scripts can get loaded after menu has been populated
    Ex for external scripts:
        www.google.com -> [www.google.com, ssl.gstatic.com] scripts     
        hovering over site preview loads
           [clients.google.com] which doesn't show up in menu ...
        (also works with main google web page, when suggests kicks in)
  
    -> Rebuild menu, Update tooltip
       Inform user somehow (make button flash, show tooltip ...)
  
    Same problem with inline scripts...


Style:
    - maps.gmail.com: when gstatic.com is allowed, 
      scripts stats in tooltip are incorrect (because script is loading other scripts,
      maybe happens after DOM loaded ??)

  - google search with inline js turned off:
      table doesn't expand to 100% width, so looks weird

- bug when switching to scriptstorage:
  local settings should be per site, not per domain:
    www.google.com and images.google.com are using the same settings
- imp.free.fr, zdnet: main icon moves left with menu
- http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/default.asp
  was jumping lines in menu (menuitems with children)
  -> reset width to auto
- http://www.extremecarving.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=13&t=9810
  gray menuitems
- style problems (site's css takes over) on
  shoutcast.com, dev.opera.com
- makeuseof(.com?) zooms icons

Strange:
- No events firing after external script errors (or so it seems):
  with http://forum.skins.be/
       when allowing forum.skins.be scripts only.
  -> Triggers a few errors,
     if using event logger userjs, we get no more events!
  NB: when blocking forum.skins.be scripts, it works

TESTING:

- http://www.sticker-autocollant.com/stickers-pc-portable/608-stickers-autocollants-pc-portable.html

- simple page with one external script:
  http://sandbox.leigeber.com/dropdown-menu/index.html
- simple page with 2 external scripts (1 in domain, 1 outside)
  http://www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html
- trademe.co.nz
  in and out of domain ext scripts, some of which are blocked
  by content blocker (ads)
