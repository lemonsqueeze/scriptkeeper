    http://my.opera.com/community/forums/topic.dml?id=241208
  as well as noscript, notscripts and external_scripts projects,
  for the initial inspiration.

- Opera Dragonfly to make debugging this thing possible.

- Mark "Tarquin" Wilton-Jones' disablescript.js
    http://www.howtocreate.co.uk/operaStuff/userJavaScript.html
  and the so very mischievous "pretend javascript is disabled by tweaking
  <noscript> tags" idea.

  - w3schools.com's javascript and DOM tutorials
  - The documentation and community forums at opera.com.
  - Various gems revealing the deep mysteries of CSS to the uninitiated,

- The so very unholy "reload from cache by simulating click on an injected link"
  js trick using mozilla's simulateClick() method,
  whose author shall remain anonymous for now as i lost the link

- And last but not least,
  Premasagar Rose's utterly outrageous injected iframe tricks,
    https://github.com/premasagar/appleofmyiframe
  which finally put an end to endless fighting with the pages's css
  (jsarmor often losing).
