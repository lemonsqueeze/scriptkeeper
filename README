                     [ noscript on steroids for opera ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

jsarmor, like noscript, gives the user control over what scripts get run in
a page. The interface aims at being cute, functional and easy to use, but
not by hiding everything away from the user. So if you occasionally like to
find out what's going on in a page, you'll find jsarmor fun to use =)


Installation:
  - copy to opera userjs directory

Make sure:
  - opera supports localstorage (11.50 and later should be fine)
  - userjs storage quota is not set 0
    (set opera:config#PersistentStorage|UserJSStorageQuota to 1000)
  - userjs is enabled (opera:config#UserPrefs|UserJavaScript)
  - userjs is enabled for https (opera:config#UserPrefs|UserJavaScriptonHTTPS)
    otherwise no filtering on encrypted pages
