                                  jsarmor
                                  =======

                     [ noscript on steroids for opera ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

jsarmor, like noscript, gives the user control over what scripts get run in
a page. The interface aims at being cute, functional and easy to use, but
not by hiding everything away from the user. So if you occasionally like to
find out what's going on in a page, you'll find jsarmor fun to use =)


Installation:
  - as an extension: Install extension, in the popup under 'privacy',
                     enable interaction with secure pages and private tabs 		     
  - as userjs: Copy jsarmor.js to opera userjs directory

For now make sure:
  - opera supports localstorage (11.50 and later should be fine)
  - userjs storage quota is not set 0
    (set opera:config#PersistentStorage|UserJSStorageQuota to 1000)
  - userjs is enabled (opera:config#UserPrefs|UserJavaScript)
  - userjs is enabled for https (opera:config#UserPrefs|UserJavaScriptonHTTPS)
    otherwise no filtering on encrypted pages


Features:
  - Zero click UI, just mouse over!

  - 4 modes of filtering:
    * block all: block all external scripts.
                 can block inline scripts as well.
    * filtered:  only current site allowed by default  (same origin policy)
    	         select other sites to allow.
    * relaxed:   related and helper domains allowed as well.
    * allow all: load everything.

  - Per page/site/domain/global settings for flexibility.
    Want to disable js just on foo.com ?
    Switch to site settings, choose 'block all' mode.
    Other sites won't be affected.

    Note: For 'filtered' mode when scope is global,
          allowed sites only apply to current site.
	  To allow a domain globally, see below.

  - Global whitelist of domains.
    (So you don't have to enable gstatic.com everywhere google maps are used)
    Mouse over the right part of the items in the menu, each site has a
    correponding icon to enable it globally.

  - Show if some scripts failed to load.

  - Disable javascript while still allowing userjs to run:
    choose 'block all' mode, block inline scripts, and select 
    'pretend js disabled'.

  - Host based filtering to counter DNS alias tricks.
    For example on wired.com, stats.wired.com actually points to an
    external tracker (condenast.112.2o7.net).
    With domain based filtering you're screwed !

  - Detailed info on page scripts.
    see 'Details' tab for full scripts' urls,
    and blocked/allowed/loaded status.
