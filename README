                                  jsarmor
                                  =======

                     [ noscript on steroids for opera ! ]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

jsarmor, like noscript, gives the user control over what scripts get run in
a page. The interface aims at being cute, functional and easy to use, but
not by hiding everything away. If you occasionally like to find out what's
going on in a page, you'll find jsarmor fun to use =)


Installation:
  - as userjs: Copy jsarmor.js to opera userjs directory
  - as an extension: 
       [ NOT WORKING YET, OUTSTANDING ISSUES REMAINING !! ]
       [  Do not use unless you feel like debugging it.   ]


Also make sure:
  - you're using opera 11.00 or later (needs scriptstorage support)
  - userjs is enabled (opera:config#UserPrefs|UserJavaScript)
  - userjs is enabled for https (opera:config#UserPrefs|UserJavaScriptonHTTPS)
    otherwise no filtering on encrypted pages
  - You may want to disable the speculative parser (opera:config#Speculative)
    otherwise blocked scripts still get downloaded (opera 11.60 and above)


Features:
  - Zero click UI, just mouse over!

  - 4 modes of filtering:
    * block all: block everything (inline and external scripts)
       	         handle <noscript> tags as if javascript was disabled in opera.
    * filtered:  only current site allowed by default  (same origin policy)
    	         select other sites to allow.
    * relaxed:   related and helper domains allowed as well.
      		 (current domain, cdns, apis ...)
    * allow all: load everything.

  - Disable javascript while still allowing userjs and extensions to run:
    just switch to 'block all' !

  - Per page/site/domain/global settings for flexibility.
    Want to disable js just on foo.com ?
    Switch to site settings, choose 'block all' mode.
    Other sites won't be affected.

    Note: For 'filtered' mode when scope is global,
          allowed sites only apply to current site.
	  To allow a site globally, see below.

  - Global whitelist.
    (So you don't have to enable gstatic.com everywhere google maps are used)
    Mouse over the right part of the items in the menu, each site has a
    correponding icon to enable it globally.

  - Show if some scripts failed to load.

  - Host based filtering to counter DNS alias tricks.
    For example on wired.com, stats.wired.com actually points to an
    external tracker (condenast.112.2o7.net).
    With domain based filtering you're screwed !

  - Detailed info on page scripts.
    see 'Details' tab for full scripts' urls,
    and blocked/allowed/loaded status.
